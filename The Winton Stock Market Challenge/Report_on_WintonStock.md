##[3. The Winton Stock Market Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-winton-stock-market-challenge)

### 3.1 Overview

**Goal:** 

- To Find the hidden signal in the terabytes of noisy, non-stationary data via novel statistical modelling and data mining techniques. In this competition the challenge is **to predict the return of a stock, given the history of the past few days.**





**Evaluation Method**: 

- Provide 5-day windows of time, days D-2, D-1, D, D+1, and D+2. You are given returns in days D-2, D-1, and part of day D, and you are asked to predict the returns in the rest of day D, and in days D+1 and D+2.

- Weighted Mean Absolute Error *Weighted Factors is associated with the return*(similiar with the Benchmark competition):

Provide 5-day windows of time, days D-2, D-1, D, D+1, and D+2. You are given returns in days D-2, D-1, and part of day D, and you are asked to predict the returns in the rest of day D, and in days D+1 and D+2.

During day D, there is intraday return data, which are the returns at different points in the day. We provide 180 minutes of data, from t=1 to t=180. In the training set you are given the full 180 minutes, in the test set just the first 120 minutes are provided.

For each 5-day window, we also provide **25 features**, Feature_1 to Feature_25. These may or may not be useful in your prediction.

Each row in the dataset is an arbitrary stock at an arbitrary 5 day time window.
